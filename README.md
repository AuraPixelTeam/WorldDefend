## Documentation
- This plugin allows you to protect your world from grief, break, pvp, command, item, decay.
- For example, you can use `/wd build world true` to prevent other players from destroying your world named `world`.
- You can also use /wd pvp world false to disable pvp in world.
- You Want to keep a world-only inventory called `MyStuff`? don't worry WorldDefend can also help you just `/wd keepinv MyStuff true` immediately that world will keep your inventory when you die.
- You hate other people using wheat seed in the world called `SkyBlock` without knowing its `TypeId`? It's okay just hold the wheat seed in your hand and use `/wd banitem SkyBlock`
